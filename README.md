# Data_Wrangling_Project
A project to practice wrangling a data set so it is ready for analysis. 

In this project, I was given a dataset containing information about job openings. It contained over 55,000 records with 11 different variables. 
The information was poorly formatted and required the use of data cleaning techniques. 

Have a look at Task1 and Task2 notebooks to see my approach to working through cleaning the dataset. I used pandas, numpy and regular expression throughout the notebooks.
